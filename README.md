# LegacyForgeBridge

LegacyForgeBridge is an experimental Fabric 1.21.11 compatibility and conversion layer for legacy Minecraft Forge 1.7.10 mods.

## Project goals

1. Let a modern Fabric 1.21.11 client interoperate with a clean Forge 1.7.10 server as the first networking milestone.
2. Scan legacy Forge 1.7.10 mod JARs from `minecraft/old-mods`.
3. Analyze and convert supported legacy bytecode/API usage into modern equivalents.
4. Write converted artifacts to `minecraft/mods` for loading on the next launch.
5. Cache source hashes so unchanged legacy mods are not converted again.
6. Prefer modern Fabric/vanilla APIs and Mixins over preserving obsolete implementation details such as direct OpenGL or old CoreMod transformers.

## Status

Early development. The first milestone is a buildable Fabric 1.21.11 bridge foundation with diagnostics, legacy-mod discovery, conversion caching, bytecode analysis, and an FML handshake state-machine foundation.

> This project does not claim universal Forge 1.7.10 mod compatibility yet. Unsupported operations must fail explicitly and produce diagnostics instead of silently emitting broken converted JARs.
